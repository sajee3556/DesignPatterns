Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development.

1.Creational design patterns: Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects.
                These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class
    1.Builder
    2.Singleton

2.Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
                           The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.
        These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.


        1. Decorator pattern

3. Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.In these design patterns,
                the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and
                still should be loosely coupled.
            That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and
             dependencies.

    1.Strategy Pattern
    2.Observer Pattern
